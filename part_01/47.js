// Hoisting


// function Hoisting

// Like traditional function expressions, arrow functions are not hoisted, and so you cannot call them before you declare them. They are also always anonymousâ€”there is no way to name an arrow function.

hello();

function hello(){
    console.log("hello world");
}

// In terms of variables and constants, keyword var is hoisted and let and const does not allow hoisting.

a=5;
console.log(a);

var a;
