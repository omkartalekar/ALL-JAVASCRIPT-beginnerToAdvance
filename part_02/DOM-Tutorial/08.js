// getElementsByTagName() method returns a live HTMLCollection of elements with the given tag name. 

// All descendants of the specified element are searched, but not the element itself. The returned list is live, which means it updates itself with the DOM tree automatically. Therefore, there is no need to call Element.

let navItems=document.getElementsByTagName("a");
console.log(navItem);
